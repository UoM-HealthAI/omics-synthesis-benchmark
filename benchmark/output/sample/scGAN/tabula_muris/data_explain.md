  üìä scGAN vs Real Data Analysis Results

  Data Overview:

  - Real Data: 57,004 cells √ó 18,996 genes (subsampled to 3,000
   for comparison)
  - Generated Data: 5,400 cells √ó 18,996 genes (matched to
  3,000 for fair comparison)
  - Cell Types: 12 unique cell types identified

  Key Findings:

  1. Expression Statistics

  Real Data:          Generated Data:
  Mean: 0.396         Mean: 0.011  (38x lower)
  Std:  7.818         Std:  0.057  (138x lower)
  Max:  6,314         Max:  3.365  (1,877x lower)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: scGAN generated data has much lower expression 
  values than real data.

  2. Sparsity Analysis

  Real data sparsity:      90.1% (normal for single-cell data)
  Generated data sparsity: 75.8% (less sparse than real data)

  3. Per-cell Expression

  Real data:      Mean: 7,517, Std: 7,942 (natural variation)
  Generated data: Mean: 200,   Std: 0     (artificial
  uniformity)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Generated cells have identical total expression
  (std=0), indicating lack of realistic cell-to-cell variation.

  4. Quality Metrics

  Mean pairwise distance:
  - Real: 930.42 (good separation between cells)
  - Generated: 0.09 (cells are nearly identical)

  Silhouette score: -0.08 (poor clustering, but typical for
  single-cell data)

  üîç Analysis Summary:

  Issues with scGAN Generated Data:
  1. Scale Problem: Generated values are 38√ó lower than real
  data
  2. No Cell Diversity: All generated cells have identical
  total expression
  3. Reduced Dynamic Range: Max expression 1,877√ó lower than
  real data
  4. Artificial Uniformity: No realistic biological variation

  Potential Causes:
  1. Training Issues: Model may not have converged properly
  2. Data Preprocessing: Normalization/scaling issues during
  training
  3. Architecture Limitations: scGAN may struggle with
  high-dimensional sparse data
  4. Parameter Settings: Generation parameters may need
  adjustment

  Recommendations:
  1. Check scGAN training logs for convergence
  2. Verify data preprocessing pipeline
  3. Adjust generation parameters (temperature, noise levels)
  4. Consider longer training or different architectures

  The analysis provides comprehensive insights into the quality
   of scGAN-generated single-cell data compared to real
  biological data.
