  File Format

  - Type: NumPy compressed archive (.npz format)
  - Size: ~1.46 MB in memory when loaded

  Data Structure

  The file contains a single array:

  cell_gen:
  - Shape: (3000, 128)
  - Data type: float32
  - Dimensions: 3000 cells Ã— 128 genes/features

  Data Characteristics

  - Expression values: Continuous floating-point numbers
  - Range: -0.750 to 0.684
  - Mean: ~0.0009 (centered around zero)
  - Standard deviation: ~0.088
  - Sparsity: 0% (no zero values - dense matrix)

  Interpretation

  This represents unconditionally generated single-cell expression data from
   your scDiffusion model:

  1. Rows (3000): Individual synthetic cells generated by the diffusion
  model
  2. Columns (128): Gene expression features/dimensions
  3. Values: Normalized expression levels for each gene in each cell
  4. Generation: These are artificial cells created without any conditioning
   labels - purely from the learned distribution

  The data shows typical characteristics of diffusion model output -
  continuous values with a relatively narrow range and normal-like
  distribution around zero.
